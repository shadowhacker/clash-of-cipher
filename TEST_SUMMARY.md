## Testing Approach

The testing strategy for Clash of Cipher includes both unit tests and integration tests to ensure game mechanics work correctly.

Two testing approaches have been implemented:
1. **Jest-based tests**: Comprehensive tests using the Jest framework
2. **Basic tests**: Simple test files that can run without Jest dependencies

## Running Tests

- Run full test suite: `npm run test`
- Run basic tests: `npm run test:basic`

## Basic Test Results

- Total tests: 4
- Passed: 4 âœ…
- Failed: 0 
- Warnings: 0 


## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests

#### Random Utilities
- Security and integrity of random number generation
- Array shuffling functionality
- Deterministic behavior for testing

#### Symbol Management
- Symbol selection based on game level
- Code generation with appropriate symbols
- Grid creation with correct distribution

#### Symbol Distribution
- Appropriate difficulty scaling across levels
- Balanced distribution in grids
- Randomness of symbol placement

#### Symbol Caching
- Storage and retrieval of symbols
- Cache versioning and management
- Preloading mechanism

### Integration Tests

#### Game Progression
- Level advancement mechanics
- Difficulty scaling across levels
- Symbol distribution changes with level

#### Game Flow
- Complete game cycle validation
- Symbol preloading before game start
- Grid verification

## Implementation Notes

The test suite is continuously improving with CI/CD integration. Key features:

1. Automated test runs in GitHub Actions
2. Coverage reports published to GitHub Pages
3. Basic tests that work without Jest dependencies
4. Custom mocking for browser APIs

## Known Issues

- One test for handling image loading errors is currently skipped and requires fixing
- Some randomness tests may occasionally show warnings about duplicate grids
