# Clash of Cipher - Test Summary

This document summarizes the testing approach, methodology, and coverage for the Clash of Cipher game.

## Testing Approach

The testing strategy for Clash of Cipher includes both unit tests and integration tests to ensure game mechanics work correctly. 

Two testing approaches have been implemented:
1. **Jest-based tests**: Comprehensive tests using the Jest framework
2. **Basic tests**: Simple test files that can run without Jest dependencies

## Running Tests

- Run full test suite: `npm run test`
- Run basic tests: `npm run test:basic`

All tests should pass successfully.

## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests

#### Random Utilities
- Security and integrity of random number generation
- Array shuffling functionality
- Deterministic behavior for testing

#### Symbol Management
- Symbol selection based on game level
- Code generation with appropriate symbols
- Grid creation with correct distribution

#### Symbol Distribution
- Appropriate difficulty scaling across levels
- Balanced distribution in grids
- Randomness of symbol placement

#### Symbol Caching
- Storage and retrieval of symbols
- Cache versioning and management
- Preloading mechanism

### Integration Tests

#### Game Progression
- Level advancement mechanics
- Difficulty scaling across levels
- Symbol distribution changes with level

#### Game Flow
- Complete game cycle validation
- Symbol preloading before game start
- Grid verification

## Implementation Notes

The test suite faced some challenges with Jest compatibility in an ES module environment. These have been addressed with:

1. Additional configuration in jest.config.cjs
2. Specialized test mocks for hooks and browser APIs
3. Basic test alternatives that don't depend on Jest
4. Custom mocking for the Canvas API and image loading

All tests now pass successfully in both the basic test runner and the full Jest test suite.

## Future Improvements

- Add more comprehensive UI component tests
- Expand test coverage for player scoring
- Add performance tests for symbol loading
